# If-Else Should Have Gone
## How to avoid complex If-Else statements with state objects

I wrote a program to avoid using If-Else statements, when we need to operate with an object's states. 
Every check we can make inside every state, instead of make it in main class.  

I made it base on Nicklas Millard (https://medium.com/@nmillard) article "Stop Using If-Else Statements" (https://medium.com/swlh/stop-using-if-else-statements-f4d2323e6e4). 
I tried to convert his code to Java language and interpreter some actions to make the code working and show the visual process of the solution.
